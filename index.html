<meta property="og:description" content="I'm James. I turn ideas into products, ventures, and experiences. From headhunting to hacking, I connect people, tech, and moments that change trajectories. Oh, and I’ve had plenty of thumbs-down along the way. Rejection for new business? Yeah, it’s part of the deal. But I’ve never kept score of my win-lose ratio. Doing so would be deeply dispiriting. What I do know is that I kept going—reframing, learning, adapting. If someone really needs the receipts, they’ll ask. And when they do, I’ll have stories—not just names." />

  <strong>Hi. I'm James</strong>
  <p>
I make ideas tangible—through code, design, and story. Some became ventures. Some didn’t. A few made money. All taught me something.</p>
<p>
My background? Recruitment. Consultancy. Agency work. Headhunting. Advisory. Mixed with new business—because I had to get clients too. Sometimes it was serendipity: a rooftop drink, a missed flight, a conversation that cracked open a market. Other times, it was cold precision: outreach, follow-up, close.
</p>
<p>
I think it’s called talent acquisition now. I’ve done it globally, across industries and borders. I didn’t just find talent—I attracted it. Through positioning, insight, and conversations that resonated.</p>
<p>I'm aware of the tools recruiters lean on today.  They're part of the landscape.</p> 
<p>
I introduced rare technical specialists into startups, trading floors, and telecom labs—before fintech was a buzzword and MySQL was stable. I didn’t overly rely on just job descriptions. I spoke with the actual hiring managers.  I uncovered the real requirements, spoke the language of the role, and drilled deep in interviews. I negotiated salaries, scopes, payment terms. I understood enough about contracts, compliance, and payroll to keep things smooth.
</p>
<p>
I advised clients on hiring strategy, market positioning, and how to reach the kind of talent that doesn’t respond to job ads. I coached candidates—not formally, but in the way you do when someone’s stuck and one question unlocks everything. I helped them reframe their value, rewrite their narrative, and walk into rooms they didn’t think they belonged in—until they did.</p>
